Hello there, my name is Ryan Neiderlander and I am a graduate of Pittsburgh Technical College with an Associate’s Degree in Web/UX design. I want to take your ideas and turn them into a web site to help your business’s online presents grow. I can use my knowledge of WordPress to design your page, or design it from the grow up with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make your website standout versus other businesses within your market. I enjoy working with a client to take their ideas and bringing them together to build their website. 

Here is a piece description for one piece that my portfolio will show, following the format outlined on Blackboard:
